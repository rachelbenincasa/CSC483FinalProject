# CSC483FinalProject

Taken from slides:

The Proposal (2-3 pages)
● 1. General project idea (1-2 paragraphs). What will be the final outcome?
● 2. The problem: Define the problem in terms of the input and output (1-2
paragraphs including examples)
○ What problem you are going to solve (not how)
○ Include examples
○ This has nothing to do with the actual solutions: indexing
○ Do not answer how you are going to solve the problem yet
● 3. Dataset(s): Describe the data you will work with
○ How many examples?
○ Citation and source (link)
○ It needs to be readily available (downloadable); you do not have time to build a dataset
● 4. Baselines and Evaluation (1-2 paragraphs)
○ Define at least one baseline. A baseline is a model that is very simple
■ Homeworks
■ Choose randomly
○ Report results with the baseline in the proposal. Otherwise it will not be approved
■ Because if you don’t do better than the baseline you don’t have a decent project (at the
end)
● 5. Experiments and Results (2-3 paragraphs)
○ What is your proposed solution?
○ “I will replicate the solutions reported in paper X” is fine
○ Running code available in GitHub is not enough
■ If you can download the implementation, you do not credit for running it
■ Reusing and adapting code is fine, reading APIs and using them for your needs is fine
